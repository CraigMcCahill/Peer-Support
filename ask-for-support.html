		<p>Young people told us that the three main things
			they want from their friends are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="teal">Listening and emotional support</li>
			<li class="pink">A reality check</li>
			<li class="yellow">Just doing normal things together</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You don't have to be an expert to help</p>

	<div class="section black" data-anchor="boundaries">    	
    	<p>Before you talk to anyone, you need to decide for yourself how much you’re willing to tell. We find it useful to make the following lists:</p>
    	<ul>	
			<li class="pink">The things you’re okay with most people knowing</li>
			<li class="yellow">The things you’re okay with some people knowing</li>
			<li class="teal">The things you want to keep private</li>
		</ul>		
    </div>

	 <div class="section black" data-anchor="professionals">
		<h2 class="pink">What are professionals there to do?</h2>
		<p>It's important to understand what professionals are there to give and where a friend’s responsibilities end. We have provided links for ways to get anonymous help and more specific help from services locally at the end.</p>
    </div>

	 <div class="section black" data-anchor="isolation">
		<p>It may be difficult for you to ask for help from your friends if they haven’t seen you in a while. This could be because you haven’t felt like it, or because somebody else doesn’t want you to.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;I've definitely been judged by my actions or for things I had no control over.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section black" data-anchor="isolation-from-friends">
		<p>Even if you feel like your friends are angry with you, remember that it is not your fault.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;Just remember who your real friends are innit 100%&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="section black" data-anchor="decisions">
		<p>Okay, so now you’ve decided how much you’re going to tell and to ask for support, your friend might want to give you advice. It’s important to remember that the advice can be helpful or unhelpful – and you decide what to do with it.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;It's somebody you can talk to. And you know they won’t report it to the police or tell a teacher.&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<p class="teal">&ldquo;Gave me appropriate advice when I needed it.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>

	
   <div class="section black" data-anchor="quotes">
		<p>It's important to remember that everyone finds different things helpful when they are going through a difficult situation. This is okay.</p>

		<p>Here's what young people told us that their friends did for them:</p>
		<br>
		<p class="pink">&ldquo;Calmed me down, told me this wasn’t the end&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;Allowed me to talk through things or provided me with distractions&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<p class="teal">&ldquo;Ignored or dismissed an issue, so that I felt unjustified in my anxieties/feelings.&rdquo;</p>
   </div>

   <div class="section black" data-anchor="alone-time">
		<p>There may be times where you don't want any support from your friends and you just want to be left alone – that’s okay too and any good friend should understand this.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="pink">&ldquo;I like alone time too&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;Meeting new people scares me, teenagers can be judgemental&rdquo;</p>
   </div>

	<div class="section black" data-anchor="class-notes">
		<p>You could ask your friends to share their class notes with you or help you catch up with the work you missed.</p>
		<p>There are also people who should help make your return to school a little bit easier. Two key people that can help with this are school counsellors and learning mentors.</p>
   </div>
 <div class="section black" data-anchor="bullied">		
		<p class="pink">&ldquo;Being bullied by my whole year group, it just destroyed me and made it very difficult to see a good future for myself.&rdquo;</p>	
   </div>
    
    <div class="section black" data-anchor="difficult-situations">		
		<p>Dealing with difficult situations is a process for everyone involved – for both the person receiving and giving support.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The best support will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="pink">Be understanding</li>
			<li class="teal">Be flexible</li>
			<li class="yellow">Make your friendship stronger</li>
		</ul>
   </div>

		<p class="pink">When you feel like it’s time to get help from someone else, here's where you can go:</p>
