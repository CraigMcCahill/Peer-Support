		<p>Young people told us that the three main things
			they want from their friends are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="teal">Listening and emotional support</li>
			<li class="pink">A reality check</li>
			<li class="yellow">Just doing normal things together</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You don't have to be an expert to help</p>
		<br>

	</div>

	<div class="section black" data-anchor="boundaries">    	
    	<p>It's important to set boundaries with your friend who needs support. This includes:</p>
    	<ul>	
			<li class="pink">How you can help</li>
			<li class="yellow">When you can help &mdash; you can’t be a 24 hour advice line!</li>
			<li class="teal">Where your abilities end</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Above all, you have to keep yourself safe and never put yourself in danger to help a friend!</b></p>
    </div>

	 <div class="section black" data-anchor="professionals">
		<h2 class="pink">What are professionals there to do?</h2>
		<p>It's important to understand what professionals are there to give and where a friend’s responsibilities end. We have provided links for ways to get anonymous help and more specific help from services locally at the end.</p>
    </div>

	 <div class="section black" data-anchor="isolation">
		<p>Be mindful that isolation from family and friends could be part of the problem. This is particularly the case if your friend is experiencing mental health problems. Shutting themselves away could be how they deal with things.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow"><b>Don't take it personally.</b></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section black" data-anchor="isolation-from-friends">
		<p>Also, isolation from friends or family could be something your friend is not choosing. Someone else might be stopping them from seeing certain people.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;I've definitely been judged by my actions or for things I had no control over.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="section black" data-anchor="decisions">
		<p>Let your friend make decisions about their own life. That includes what to tell, who to tell, when to get help etc.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="teal">&ldquo;Gave me appropriate advice when I needed it.&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;It's somebody you can talk to. And you know they won’t report it to the police or tell a teacher.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>


   <div class="section black" data-anchor="quotes">
		<p>It's important to remember that everyone finds different things helpful when they are going through a difficult situation. This is okay.</p>

		<p>Here's what young people told us that their friends did for them:</p>
		<br>
		<p class="pink">&ldquo;Calmed me down, told me this wasn’t the end&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="yellow">&ldquo;Allowed me to talk through things or provided me with distractions&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<p class="teal">&ldquo;Ignored or dismissed an issue, so that I felt unjustified in my anxieties/feelings.&rdquo;</p>
   </div>


   <div class="section black" data-anchor="left-alone">
		<p>Some people just prefer to be left alone to deal with their problems in their own time. One young person who responded to our survey said, &ldquo;I like alone time too&rdquo;. Another said, &ldquo;meeting new people scares me, teenagers can be judgemental&rdquo;.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p class="yellow"><b>Don't take it personally if a friend doesn’t always want to talk to you about something.</b></p>
    </div>


	<div class="section black" data-anchor="missed-school">    	
    	<p>Sometimes if your friends have really serious issues they may have missed school for a long time. If this is the case, it can be really difficult for them to start coming back.</p>
    	<br>
    	<p>But there are some things you can do to help:</p>
    		
    	<div class="pure-g">
			<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
				<ul>
					<li class="pink">Acknowledge this is a difficult process for your friend</li>
					<br>
					<li class="yellow">Help them with their work &mdash; sharing your notes taken in class</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
			<ul>
				<li class="teal">Help stop rumours from spreading &mdash; whether they are true or false</li>
				<br>
				<li class="pink">Support your friend  to access Learning Mentors or counsellors at school</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
    </div>
    </div>

     <div class="section black" data-anchor="bullied">		
		<p class="pink">&ldquo;Being bullied by my whole year group, it just destroyed me and made it very difficult to see a good future for myself.&rdquo;</p>	
   </div>
    
    <div class="section black" data-anchor="difficult-situations">		
		<p>Dealing with difficult situations is a process for everyone involved – for both the person receiving and giving support.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The best support will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="pink">Be understanding</li>
			<li class="teal">Be flexible</li>
			<li class="yellow">Make your friendship stronger</li>
		</ul>
   </div>

	 <div class="section black" data-anchor="help">		
		<p class="pink">When you feel like it’s time to get help from someone else, here's where you can go:</p>
